Data Types in Python

1. Numbers
 - Integer: All the numbers excluding decimal places and fraction.

 2. Strings: This is used to store anything in python, literally anything
    that are available on your keyboard.
    You have to use quotes to store anything and it will be
    considered as string. You can use double Quotes (“”) or
    single quotes ('') to store both works same.

3. Boolean: Theres nothing much to say this is the data type which
    will and always give the result of True and False.
