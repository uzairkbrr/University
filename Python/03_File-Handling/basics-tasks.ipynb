    "\n",
    "Run-length encoding is a simple data compression technique that can be effective when repeated values occur at adjacent positions within a list. Compression is achieved by replacing groups of repeated values with one copy of the value, followed by the number of times that the value should be repeated. For example, the list \n",

    "[\"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"B\", \"B\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "would be compressed as `[\"A\", 12, \"B\", 4, \"A\", 6, \"B\", 1]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a recursive function that implements the run-length compression technique\n",
    "described above. Your function will take a list or a string as its only parameter. It should return the run-length compressed list as its only result. Include a main program that reads a string from the user, compresses it, and displays the run-length encoded result."
